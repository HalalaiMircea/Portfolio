        <h3>About Me</h3>
        <p>
            Hi, I'm <b>Mircea-Costin Hălălai</b>, a software engineer with a background in Fullstack and Android
            development. I have a bachelor in Computers and Information Technology from the University of Bucharest,
            and I love making tools and applications that people find useful.

<h3>What made you choose this website design?</h3>
<p>
    For my personal projects I like coming up with wild and unique ideas. One day I stumbled upon
    <a href="https://jdan.github.io/98.css" target="_blank">98.css</a> and
    <a href="https://khang-nd.github.io/7.css" target="_blank">7.css</a>
    stylesheet libraries and bookmarked them as the idea of making a modern app look like the good ol' days from my
    childhood was really appealing. Half a year later, when I became more conscious about my career, I decided to make a
    portfolio site based on 7.css, shooting two birds with one stone by using Blazor WebAssembly - a tech I had been
    eager to tryout in the past.
